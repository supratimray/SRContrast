1. Use Azi and Ele instead of eccentricity and polar angle
2. Gabor 0 and 1 could potentially have different SF, base orientation, azi and ele
3. Use "Change in orientation" instead of target orientation.
4. Temporal frequency could be run in the "flipped mode", in which there are exactly two non-zero TFs, with the first non-zero temporal frequency at Gabor 0 is coupled with the other non-zero TF at Gabor 1. There are a total of 3 TF pairs - {0,0}, {TF1,TF2} and {TF2,TF1}

1. Update digital outevents to have very few, but longish pulses. Should be able to run with a single ITC18 or Labjack.

1. Feature Attention Mode. This requires two orientations - O1 and O2. Across blocks, base orientations will change in the following manner - {O1,O1},{O2,O1},{O1,O2},{O2,O2}.



// To do

1. Get Staircase option to work.
2. The Feature attention condition with two orientations is sub-optimal for EEG, since different FA conditions are actually associated with different orientations in the two sides. Using a task like Cohen and Maunsell, 2011, Neuron, in which subjects have to detect either changes in orientation of spatial frequency across blocks, will be better.
3. Make change to optionally run in a valid-invalid design. This design is available in GaborRFMap
